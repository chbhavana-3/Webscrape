Project Description:
This Python script enables web scraping of real estate data from the Makaan website. Leveraging the requests library to retrieve web pages and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content, the script extracts key information including area, locality, number of bathrooms, and price of properties listed on the platform. Subsequently, the extracted data is structured into a systematic format using pandas, facilitating easy manipulation and analysis.
